    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pizza, an italian favourite!</p>
    <p>BREAD AND BUTTER, COS'Ãˆ QUESTO!!!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6 slices of bread</li>
      <li>6 tbsp. unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
      <li>2/3 cup pizza sauce</li>
      <li>6 diced ounces of mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>18 slices pepperoni</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet
        with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread butter generously on both sides of the bread slices and set them
        out on the prepared baking sheet. Freshly grate Parmigiano-Reggiono
        cheese on top of each bread slice, preeing the cheese lightly into the
        butter so it sticks better. Turn bread slices over, so cheese side is
        down. Top with pizza sauce, making sure to spread it evenly on top of
        the slices.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms start to turn golden brown, 10
        to 12 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top with mozzarella and 3 pepperoni slices each (or toppings of your
        choice). Bake until mozzarella has melted and bottom crust is crispy and
        well browned, 10 to 12 minutes more.
      </li>
    </ol>
