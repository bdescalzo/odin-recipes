    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This doesn't need a presentation... MOZZARELLA!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ tsp citric acid</li>
      <li>¼ rennet tablet or ¼ tsp liquid rennet</li>
      <li>1 cup + ¼ cup chlorine-free water</li>
      <li>
        1 gallon of milk (whole milk: pasteurized or unpasteurized, not
        ultra-pasteurized)
      </li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt + more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Dissolve 1 ½ teaspoons citric acid with 1 cup water in a large,
        non-reactive pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl, combine the rennet with 1/4 cup water, and set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use non-super cold milk (let it sit out for a little so it isn't
        refrigerator-cold. I don't know why, it just works better) and heat it
        in the pot with the citric acid until it reaches 90°F.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove milk mixture from the heat, add your rennet mixture, and stir it
        with the long-handled spatula for 30 seconds. Let sit and don't touch
        it!
      </li>
      <li>
        After five minutes, your curd will look like a solid, with lots of
        liquid on the side. The solids are the curd, the liquid is the whey, and
        there's still lots of whey in your curd at this point. If it hasn't yet
        formed into a soft tofu- or custard-like structure, let it sit a bit
        longer, covered.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using your sharp knife, cut the curd into squares by cutting long,
        parallel slices about an inch wide in one direction and then across,
        like a checkerboard. Be sure your knife is long enough to cut all the
        way to the bottom of the pot, and try not to nick the pot's surface.
      </li>
      <li>
        At this point you've cut the curds, but you want them to release more of
        the whey. To do this, put your pot back on the stove and heat it slowly
        over medium heat to about 105° F. As the curds warm, they'll clump
        together; you want to encourage this by stirring a bit so that the whey
        leaves behind bright white clumps of curd.
      </li>
      <li>
        After the curds reach 105°, remove them from the heat and use a slotted
        spoon to transfer the curds (shaking off excess whey) into a
        microwaveable glass bowl or a strainer/colander lined with cheesecloth.
        You can lift the cheesecloth and squeeze it to coax out a little of the
        whey.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once you have your curds in the bowl, you're going to microwave them on
        high for a minute. At this point, you should definitely have your gloves
        on, because you're going to pull out the bowl from the microwave and
        start folding the curds together to make loose balls, squeezing off some
        of the excess whey in the process.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pop the lightly worked curds back in the bowl (without the whey) and put
        them back in the microwave until they reach 135° F (around 30-45
        seconds. Err on the slightly cooler side to make sure you're not
        overcooking them). Once they reach 135° F, they'll be perfect for
        stretching.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make fresh mozzarella balls, sprinkle salt onto the cheese and feel
        free to double up on gloves if your hands are sensitive. Grabbing a
        section of the cheese curds (this will be the approximate end size of
        your ball), pull the curds out to about half your wingspan, then fold it
        back over on itself and repeat. As you do this, the curds should start
        to firm up and become harder to stretch. Don't overwork your mozzarella!
        As you stretch and fold, consider the ball it will become, and try to
        make it into that shape.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once you have your ball, set it gently into the ice water and make
        another ball of mozzarella. Reheat the curds in the microwave or hot
        bath as needed to get to 135° F.
      </li>
